#  Creating Your First Minecraft Bedrock Edition Texture Pack

Welcome to the exciting world of Minecraft customization! This guide will walk you through the process of creating your very own texture pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. By the end, you'll have a personalized pack that you can use and share with your friends.

##  Project Setup: The Foundation of Your Pack

First things first, let's get your project folder set up. Minecraft needs a specific folder structure to recognize and use your texture pack.

1.  **Create Your Main Folder:** Make a new folder on your computer and give it a unique name that represents your texture pack. For this guide, we'll call it `My Awesome Pack`.

2.  **Essential Files and Folders:** Inside your main folder (`My Awesome Pack`), you'll need to create two key items:
    *   A file named `manifest.json`.
    *   A file named `pack_icon.png`.

3.  **The `textures` Folder:** This is where all your custom textures will go. Inside your main folder, create a new folder and name it exactly `textures`. Inside the `textures` folder, you can create more specific folders for different types of textures. Here are some of the most common ones:
    *   `blocks`: For the textures of all the blocks in the game.
    *   `items`: For the textures of items like swords, food, and tools.
    *   `entity`: For the textures of mobs and other entities.
    *   `ui`: For the user interface elements like menus and buttons.

Your initial folder structure should look like this:

```
My Awesome Pack/
├── manifest.json
├── pack_icon.png
└── textures/
    ├── blocks/
    ├── entity/
    └── items/
```

##  The `manifest.json` File: Your Pack's ID Card

The `manifest.json` file is crucial. It tells Minecraft all about your texture pack, including its name, description, and some unique identifiers. You can open and edit this file with any plain text editor, like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac.

Here is a template you can copy and paste into your `manifest.json` file. We'll go over what each part means below.

```json
{
  "format_version": 2,
  "header": {
    "name": "My Awesome Pack",
    "description": "A super cool texture pack made by me!",
    "uuid": "GENERATE-A-NEW-UUID-1",
    "version": [1, 0, 0],
    "min_engine_version": [1, 16, 0]
  },
  "modules": [
    {
      "type": "resources",
      "uuid": "GENERATE-A-NEW-UUID-2",
      "version": [1, 0, 0]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Understanding the `manifest.json` Values

| Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`format_version`** | This specifies the version of the manifest format. For current versions of Minecraft, `2` is the standard. |
| **`name`** | This is the name of your texture pack as it will appear in the game. You can change "My Awesome Pack" to whatever you like. |
| **`description`** | This is a short description of your texture pack that will show up under the pack name in the game. |
| **`uuid`** | This stands for Universally Unique Identifier. It's a random code that makes your pack unique. You need **two different** UUIDs in your `manifest.json`. You can generate them from a website like [uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/). **It is very important to generate your own new UUIDs.** |
| **`version`** | This is the version of your texture pack. You can update this as you release new versions of your pack. It's written as `[major, minor, patch]`. |
| **`min_engine_version`**| This tells Minecraft the minimum game version your pack is designed for. It's a good idea to set this to a recent version of the game. |
| **`modules`** | This section defines the different parts of your pack. For a texture pack, you'll have one module of the `type` "resources". |
| **`type`** | This specifies the type of content in this module. For a texture pack, it must be `"resources"`. |

## The Pack Icon: Your Pack's First Impression

The `pack_icon.png` is the image that will represent your texture pack in the game's resource pack menu.

*   **Format:** The image must be a `.png` file.
*   **Dimensions:** A good size for your pack icon is `256x256` pixels. While other sizes might work, this is a safe and standard dimension.
*   **Transparency:** Using a transparent background for your icon can make it look more professional.

You can create your pack icon in any image editing software like GIMP, Paint.NET, or Photoshop. Once you've created your icon, save it as `pack_icon.png` in the main directory of your texture pack.

##  Adding and Editing Textures: The Creative Part

Now for the fun part: changing the look of Minecraft!

### Finding the Default Textures

The easiest way to start is by editing the default Minecraft textures. You can download the official Vanilla Resource Pack from the Minecraft website to get all the default textures.

### Editing Textures

1.  **Find the Texture:** Once you have the default textures, find the one you want to edit. For example, if you want to change the appearance of a diamond sword, you would look for `diamond_sword.png` inside the `textures/items` folder.

2.  **Open and Edit:** Open the `.png` file in your preferred image editor. Now you can get creative! Redraw it, change the colors, or add new details.

3.  **Save Your Changes:** When you're happy with your new texture, save the file, making sure to keep the original file name and `.png` format. Place your new, edited texture in the corresponding folder within your own texture pack's `textures` directory. For example, your edited `diamond_sword.png` would go in `My Awesome Pack/textures/items/`.

### `textures_list.json` (Optional but Recommended)

For better performance and to avoid potential texture glitches, it's a good practice to include a `textures_list.json` file inside your `textures` folder. This file is a simple list of all your custom texture paths.

Here's an example:

```json
[
  "textures/items/diamond_sword",
  "textures/blocks/dirt",
  "textures/entity/pig/pig"
]
```

##  Testing Your Texture Pack

Once you've added a few custom textures, it's time to test them in the game!

1.  **Package Your Pack:** To easily import your texture pack into Minecraft, you can package it as a `.mcpack` file. To do this, select all the files and folders inside your `My Awesome Pack` directory, and compress them into a `.zip` file. Then, simply rename the file extension from `.zip` to `.mcpack`.

2.  **Import into Minecraft:** Double-click the `.mcpack` file. Minecraft should automatically launch and import your texture pack.

3.  **Activate Your Pack:**
    *   In Minecraft, go to `Settings` > `Global Resources`.
    *   Under `My Packs`, you should see your texture pack with its custom icon and name.
    *   Select your pack and click `Activate`.

4.  **Enjoy Your Creation:** Go into a world and check out your new custom textures!

By following these steps, you'll have a solid foundation for creating amazing and unique Minecraft Bedrock Edition texture packs. Happy crafting
